## ⚙️ How to Compile

This repository uses a **single `main.tex`** file.  
Each role-specific resume is generated by **uncommenting the correct section** in `main.tex`:

### **1️⃣ Choose the Resume Type**
Open `main.tex` and locate the section:
```latex
% \input{sections/swe/experience_swe.tex}
% \input{sections/swe/projects_swe.tex}

% \input{sections/pm/experience_pm.tex}
% \input{sections/pm/projects_pm.tex}

% \input{sections/ba/experience_ba.tex}
